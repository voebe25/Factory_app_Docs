Need :

This app is an attempt to oragnize the unorganized factory setups.

Defintions : 

Unorganized sector - unorganised sector can be understood as the sector, which is not incorporated with the government and thus, no rules are required to be followed.

Unorganized sector focuses on maximising productivity by focuing on manual labour and minimal thoughts are given on organizing the orders, data etc which leads in loss of resources, both time and money.
The first phase of the app focuses on managing orders for the factory.

Please refer the Phase 1 design document for futher information.
